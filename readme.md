# FabriK

Fabrik contains bash scripts and corresponding [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) manifest files to automate
the deployment of [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric) components in Unix-like environments.

Parameters and file paths related to Fabric components are defined as variables in the
scripts such that they can be modified as required. The relevant changes should also
be applied to the manifest files accordingly.
